        <div><b>Covid outbreak hasn't spared kids either,but cases low,complications fewer.</b></div>
        <p>NEW DELHI:<b>Covid-19</b> is affecting children much as adults, leading to an increase in their test positivity rate. However, doctors say there is no sign yet of increased severity or hospitalization needs among them, as was feared.</p>
        <p> The treatment protocol for Covid-19 in children also remains the same, said Dr AK Deorari, professor and head of paediatrics at AIIMS. He was addressing a webinar on Thursday orgainsed by AIIMS on how to manage Covid-19 in children. He added that most children were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms that subsided with basic, supportive treatment.</p>

        <b>SYMPTOMS</b>
            <ol>
                <li><i>Mild illness:-fever,sore throat etc</i></li> 
                <li><i>Moderate illness:-Pneumonia,fast breathing</i></li>
                <li><i>Servere illness:-Septic shock</i></li>
            </ol>
        <b>WARNING SIGNS</b>
            <ol type="I">
                <li><i>Diffculty in breathing or shallow breathing</i></li>
                <li><i>Blue lips or face</i></li>
                <li><i>Chest pain or pressure</i></li>
            </ol>

        <p>“Very few require hospitalisation. We saw this during the second wave and the same trend persists even now,”said Deorari.</p>
        <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/covid-19-china-outbreak-reaches-6-provinces-as-omicron-takes-hold/articleshow/88894718.cms"> Related News</a>
        <p>Dr Rakesh Lodha, paediatrics ICU head at AIIMS, said children could be protected against developing severe symptoms because of three key factors: first, ACE2 (receptors for SARS-CoV-2) are less expressed in their nasal epithelium, secondly, children have strong innate immune response due to live vaccines and frequent viral infections, and thirdly, because unlike adults fewer children suffer from comorbidities, such as diabetes.</p>
        <p>Lodha shared data from seven countries, including the US and the UK, which showed children continued to be mostly spared the worst outcome of the pandemic. “Limited data from India suggests 40-60% of hospitalised children with Covid had comorbidity,” he added.</p>
        <p>Dr Anamika Dubey, senior consultant at Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital, said very few children suffering from Covid-19 required admission. “We have had 10-12 admissions in paediatrics since January 1. Most were hospitalised due to poor intake of nutrition and dehydration caused by fever,” she added.</p>
        <p>Doctors said a close watch was needed for timely detection of multi-system inflammatory syndrome. Most children suffer from fever, sore throat, running nose and cough due to Covid-19. A very small percentage of children develop pneumonia, fast breathing and low oxygen levels.</p>
        <p>It was important to watch out for warning signs, such as difficulty breathing, blue lips or face, chest pain or pressure or inability to awaken/not interact when awake, in children suffering from mild to moderate illness. Such patients may require immediate medical attention.</p>

        <p><b>PM Modi Interacts With Startups:</b> Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday interacted with over 150 startups across different sectors. The Prime Minister, during his interaction via video conferencing, said that startups are going to be the backbone of new India. He added that from now on, January 16 is going to be celebrated as National Startup Day.</p>
        <p>"Our startups are changing the rules of the game. I believe that startups are going to be the backbone of India," said the Prime Minister during his speech.</p>
        <p>“I congratulate all the start-ups, all the youth, who are raising the flag of India in the world of start-ups. For this culture of start-ups to reach the far-flung parts of the country, it has been decided to celebrate January 16 as National Start-up Day," he said.</p>
        <p>Modi said that the government is making big changes in policies regarding startups. “The year 2022 has brought new horizons for the Indian startup ecosystem. When India will complete 100 years of independence, startups will play a huge role," Prasar Bharati quoted the PM as saying.</p>

        <div><b>India vs South Africa: India fail to conquer 'final frontier'; South Africa clinch series 2-1
        </b></div>
        <img src="https://c.tenor.com/RvzZPCVLQxgAAAAM/faf-du-plessis-du-plessis.gif" alt=cricket style="width: 50%;"> <figcaption>Test Series </figcaption>
        <p>India’s best chance to win in South Africa turned into their worst nightmare. They began the three-Test series in style in Centurion but failed to keep that momentum going. The result? Kohli & Co have lost 1-2 and a golden opportunity to announce their dominance in the only country where India have never won a Test series.</p>
        <p>The glorious Table Mountain instead stayed witness to how a young and relatively inexperienced South African team stamped its authority in style on Day Four of the final Test at Newlands on Friday afternoon. Under a clear sky, chasing 212 for victory, they won the Test by seven wickets and with an air of absolute brilliance.</p>

        <p>Keegan Petersen, a South African ‘KP’ who’s theirs to keep, led from the front. Precariously placed at 101-2, and with the ball still new, the hosts began Day Four on a cautious note. There was enough bounce in the wicket and chances kept getting created.</p>
        <b>WHY INDIA LOST THE PLOT AND THE SERIES</b>
        <ol>
            <li><i>Middle order woes</i></li>
            <li><i>The jansen factor</i></li>
            <li><i>Fixed ideas</i></li>
            <li><i>SA batters better</i></li>
            <li><i>Dropped catches and dubious DRS</i></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Luck deserted India and the rest was consumed by Petersen’s elegant and determined 113-ball 82. He shuffled at the crease, saw a sitter get dropped in the slips by Pujara off a tireless Jasprit Bumrah and came extremely close to edging the moving ball.</p>

        <p>But he stayed on. And the moment he found the space to settle, some glorious drives, punched on the front and backfoot, gradually took the session, day and match away from the visitors. Petersen eventually left and<b>Temba Bavuma</b> walked in to finish off the game with Rassie van der Dussen in style.</p>
        <p>Dean Elgar, whose own contributions remained impeccable in this series, jumped in joy and so did the  rest of the South African team. The scenes in and around the dressing room spoke volumes of what this team had just achieved.</p>
        <p>The Indian shoulders dropped. They won a toss that in hindsight was better lost, went into the game a batsman short, were plain unlucky on occasions and the pitch – unfortunately for them – began easing out just when they were praying it didn’t.</p>
        <p>Such was the state of play through the first and second session that even inside edges didn’t work, overthrows added insult to the injury, a sitter got dropped and Kohli’s men didn’t get an opportunity to verbally distract the opposition either. Petersen, Bavuma and van der Dussen had put their heads down and got to work.</p>
        <p>The very reasons India lost in Johannesburg came back to haunt them in Cape Town – lack of enough runs on the board. In the second innings of the third Test though, the continuing poor form with the bat just worsened. Outside of Rishabh Pant’s hundred and the extras given away by South Africa, the rest of the Indian batting order contributed a mere 70 runs. That is precisely where India lost this Test.</p>
